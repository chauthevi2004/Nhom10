# CS112.O11.KHTN.10 - Group 10

## Introduction

This project is developed by Group 10 as part of the CS112.O11.KHTN.10 course. The objective is to implement and compare various sorting algorithms, particularly Merge Sort, in Python. We explore both standard implementations and versions utilizing multiprocessing to enhance performance.

## Project Structure

- `create.py`: Generates datasets to test the sorting algorithms.
- `mergesortmultiprocessing.py`: Implementation of Merge Sort using Python's multiprocessing capabilities.
- `mergesortpython.py`: Standard implementation of Merge Sort in Python.
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py`: Temporary file, possibly used during development or testing.

## Setup and Usage

1. **System Requirements**: Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Use the command `git clone https://github.com/chauthevi2004/Nhom10.git` to clone the repository.
3. **Run the Scripts**: Navigate to the repository directory and execute the desired Python scripts using the command `python script_name.py`.
